# FoundryVTT Compendiums World Stormsteel
  
This is a collection of some private projects compendiums.

I'm not suggesting you should use is very bugged collection.

## Installation

It's always easiest to install modules from the in game add-on browser.

To install this module manually:
1.  Inside the Foundry "Configuration and Setup" screen, click "Add-on Modules"
2.  Click "Install Module"
3.  In the "Manifest URL" field, paste the following url:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p4535992/foundryvtt-compendiums-world-stormsteel/master/src/module.json`
4.  Click 'Install' and wait for installation to complete
5.  Don't forget to enable the module in game using the "Manage Module" button
