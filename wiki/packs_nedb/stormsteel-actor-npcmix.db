The skeletal servant you have raised is little more than a brainless husk.&nbsp; Without proper, and I mean proper, instruction, the bones in front of you might as well have remained dusty upon the floor.&nbsp; Explain the orders carefully and lay out the steps of your new servant’s tasks with exceeding care.&nbsp; Also, should you catch your skeletal friend partaking in the activities of their former life, do not scold them.&nbsp; The mundane routine of chopping wood or swinging a hammer can allow for more malleable servants as time continues.<br><em>The Book of Dark Servants, Vol III.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Skeletons are beings raised into undeath by the will of necromantic magic.&nbsp; The necromantic magics used within the ritual can either be cast by a trained hand or simply seep into the bones of the skeleton in areas of concentrated death.&nbsp; Cemeteries, catacombs, and battle fields are all subject to the sporadic rising of skeletons into their new lives.&nbsp; The magic not only keeps the skeleton “living”, but it also binds joints and bones together like spectral ligaments.&nbsp; With its second life, the skeleton acts as a semi-mindless creature serving its master’s will.</p>\n<p><strong>Spooky Scary.</strong> For the up and coming necromancer, skeletons make worthy guards for a hidden repository of forbidden knowledge.&nbsp; Skeletons will follow simple to mildly complex orders given (such as forming a protective circle or constructing minor defenses) without the necromancer needing to worry about the durability of their creations.&nbsp; The skeletons will avoid danger and refuse to injure themselves unless explicitly ordered by their master.&nbsp; Skeletons do seem to grow rather bored without direction and have been observed ambling around an area performing simple actions from their past lives.&nbsp; One notable skeleton I recall was still able to cast their fishing line, though clumsily at best, into the nearby lake.&nbsp; Skeletons, however, are not utilized for their prior skills but as guardians of the necromancer who summoned them back from the hells.&nbsp; Skeletons are more than capable when swinging a sword or firing a crossbow, finding martial prowess in death that they may have lacked in life thanks to the dark power flowing through their marrow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Author’s Note: Not all skeletal adversaries in an adventurer’s journey will be humanoid.&nbsp; Be wary, as significant magics can summon back more powerful skeletal monsters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Here we will view the commonalities of what would be considered the “bandit” class of criminal. Be advised while reviewing this information that not all bandits should be viewed with a scornful eye. While many seek harm or riches from their quarry, others thieve to survive in a world most unfair.</p>\n<p><strong>The Good.</strong> We begin with those bandits who could be seen as “noble criminals”. These bandits consist of the most downtrodden of our nations, those citizens who have struggled through poverty and oppression to scrape out a meager existence clinging to any comfort they can grasp. Consider what would drive a person to commit something so desperate as robbery or open theft in a village street. Bandits of a nobler sort may still be selfish with their earnings, taking what they have stolen to enrich their own lives or those of immediate relations. There are some bandits, however, who seek to use their pilfered goods to improve the lives of the poorer community. Be aware that often these bandits are desperate and afraid, especially during the act of robbery. They are scared, driven to crime by poor circumstances, so they may not require violence to disperse as more often than not they will not physically harm their victims. Keep an open mind as you travel through the world young adventurer and remember that were the tables turned, you may wish for mercy for such a minor infraction.</p>\n<p><strong>The Bad and Ugly.</strong> For every good-hearted soul stealing from those with too much and giving to the unfortunate, there is a truly villainous spirit lurking behind the brush of a nearby road, lying in wait for an unsuspecting victim. During your travels, adventurer, these sorts may be the most common instances of banditry you will experience. Armed with swords, clubs, and bows, the more nefarious of the bandit world prefer to ambush their prey from the shadows of hills and trees, catching traveling parties unaware. These treacherous thieves will attempt diversion and trickery in order to catch their quarry off guard should their crew be outnumbered.

I swear it's true!!!\"</p>\n<p>- Unknown Disorderly Patron at the Brass Buck Tavern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p>What more could be said about the humble crab than is not already common knowledge to those who live near or frequent the coasts of the continent. Crabs are uniquely robust little creatures often no larger than the palm of an adult human's hand, with eight segmented legs protruding from either side of its scallop-shaped carapace. This hardened chitin carapace is topped with two black eye stalks (not unlike those of a snail) through which the beast views our coastlines and oceans. It has been observed that some species of crab lack an armored shell and prefer to squat in the discarded shells of conchs. This gives the crab a rather clever and sturdy mobile home. Adorning the crabs ninth and tenth appendages near its tiny mouth are two massive claws, resembling those of a scorpion, with dull serrations marking the inner edge of each. The crab primarily utilizes these claws in its search for food, cracking open the shells of other tiny aquatic beasts or snipping off tiny pieces of undersea plant life to dine on.</p>\n</section>\n<p>While perhaps not the most dangerous companion a summoner could wish for, the crab's ability to breath both in the water and upon land makes the crustacean an ally brimming with utility. I advise caution, however, when first looking through your crab familiar's eyes, as the sideways scuttling by which the crab moves has proven to cause vomiting in some weak stomached summoners.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select:

Another bird of prey, the hawk may be differentiated from eagle species by its smaller frame. Hawks on average weigh no more than eight pounds and have a wingspan of only five feet. These miniscule raptors bear dark brown to deep red plumage unlike the eagle’s most common golden hue. Several species of these birds of prey have been observed employing different tactics in their hunting patterns as well; while the mighty eagle soars down from on high and lifts its prey off into the air with it, hawks prefer to lurk in the cover of trees, waiting for the opportune time to swoop in and surprise their prey from the shadows. Due to their keen eyesight as well as their smaller profile, hawks have been utilized as messenger birds by desert cultures for centuries. Clever and loyal, the hawk may be an option for the adventurer who prefers a raptor who enjoys the cover of shadows and stealth to aid them in their hunts.</p>\n<ul style=\"user-select: text; color:

These octopods resemble nothing more than a wet piece of bulbous taffy with eight sprawling tentacles slithering out of its central body. Upon this gelatinous body lie two observant eyes and were one to look underneath the creature they would find a sharpened bird-like beak ready to steal a probing finger away. Octopi are solely waterborne animals due to their inability to breathe air, though with effort they may remain upon land for very short durations. Sailors find pleasure in attempting to take these intelligent beasts for pets, only to find that the octopus has escaped whatever confines it was stored in time and time again. As long as an opening is as wide as its hard chitinous beak, the moldable octopus’ body will follow into inconceivably tight spaces.</p>\n<p>Many breeds of octopus also bear special pigmentation cells which expand and contract to change their body’s color. This provides the octopus with an advantage when hunting for its prey of fish and crabs as they can blend in almost seamlessly with the ocean floor or a bed of coral. Rather than outright fight (unless left with no choice) the octopus has the unique defense of spraying a cloud of ink from the underside of its body to blind its foes and make a speedy escape. Do consider the octopus as a worthy familiar form should you find yourself at sea for an extended time!</p>\n<ul style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"user-select: text;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":null,"cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 333","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"sm","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":0,"total":2},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":14,"prof":2,"total":4},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Octopus.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Octopus","displayName":40,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/Octopus.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":30,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"VpcacDOh5V4RnQIL","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"SLnyx0Ta2ksVM9QL","name":"Tentacles","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\"><p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+4 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

Cultists, as their name describes, are those members of a secret underground society (or cult) whom very often practice a dark and unholy religion with their fellows. Beware adventurer! Not every cult is simply based around religious pretexts, there are those who seek political movements, those who are power hungry, and those who deign to meddle with forces our histories have lost long ago. Let me describe for you the very basics of common cult activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Friends on the Other Side.</strong> Cultists operate entirely in secrecy outside of the normal comings and goings of everyday life. What makes the cultist so fascinating is that they often attempt to blend seamlessly in with common folk: the barkeep at your favorite tavern, the guard near the gate, or even the dancer upon the stage may all be part of an underground community based ostensibly in evil. Now, to be clear, I do not encourage paranoia as cult activity is relatively rare in comparison to other, more immediate threats to our world; however, should a clever adventurer keep a keen eye out for secretive motions or gestures, odd symbols or markings, and even whispered code words, they can be certain they have stumbled into the workings of a cult. Quite commonly cultists align themselves with an ancient power trapped or dormant somewhere upon one of the more foul planes of existence. Their goals with this dark, godly force are myriad but often include control of a political structure, the deaths of hundreds if not thousands, or simply to sew despair and chaos across the realms of mortals. Unlike the desperate and cowardly bandits pushed to the brink by circumstance, cultists are often irredeemable foes. These men and women have been programed, brain-washed, or even directly controlled by their benefactor into the ways of darkness; often they are unfortunately unable to return to society once they have ingratiated themselves too deeply within the cult's network. Cults should always be handled and broken up with the utmost care; though the humanoid pawns behind the cult can be more easily dealt with, it should be remembered that cosmically evil forces may be at work and already set well into motion behind those pawns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any Non-Good Alignment","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":"","cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{},"notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":1,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Cultist.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Cultist","displayName":40,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/CultistRedM.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"WUW4hJmgajuRKPO9","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"nfPMecUVS2iOgAKJ","name":"Leather Armor","type":"equipment","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil.

Tribal warriors act not like the guards of the city gates; rather, they function on hierarchies of honor, physical prowess, and in the legacy of deeds won in battle. Equipped with simple weapons such as spears, shortswords, or blunt maces the tribal warrior thrives within the heat of a battle, relishing in the decimation of their enemies. Theirs is a world of power struggles played upon the field of war rather than behind the closed doors of a council chamber. While one on one fights may be availed to combatants who prove themselves a worthy challenge, the tribal warrior is often not far from their allies. Utilizing simple combat techniques to pincer or route adversaries, the tribal warrior is no stranger to guerilla combat. Should you enter a tribe's hard won territory it will be likely that the tribe was alerted miles ahead of your approach to their borders. Be cautious, be wise, and keep an eye upon the rustling trees of the roadways should you stray into a land most unfamiliar. Tribal warriors respect honor and might, should you show them both then bloodshed of a greater order may be quickly avoided.</p>\n<ul style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"user-select: text;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"any alignment","race":null,"type":"Humanoid","environment":null,"cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 350","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/TribalWarriorM.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Tribal Warrior","displayName":40,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/TribalWarriorM.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"chSDWCzbFOTKXNbU","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"hbpux5uhl63ObLBg","name":"Hide Armor","type":"equipment","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts.

Note:&nbsp; Please see below the entry for “Rat” which will suffice for the description of this creature.&nbsp; Please note that “Swarms” function slightly differently in combat than singular creatures.&nbsp; Please use the rules for “Swarms” befitting your particular game system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Denizens of filth, scavengers in our sewers, and vectors of contaigens, no singular animal may present such an impact upon humanoid life as does the rat.&nbsp; Common place from the sprawling urban metropolis to the tiny barn of a poor farmer, rats inhabit every nook and cranny they may scurry in to.&nbsp; These small rodents, who can range in size from no bigger than your palm to the length of a forearm (with tail included) are quite ingenious little thieves.&nbsp; Rats are able to compress their bodies in such a manner that they can fit through spaces as small as the gap in the bottom of your door.&nbsp; Able to swim and navigate in the dark, some rats have been observed climbing out of small plumbing pipes, having scampered through the length of the tunnel to make it inside a merchant’s abode.</p>\n<p><strong>Rats Off to You.</strong> While many may dismiss the rat as nothing more than a common pest, even those not utilized as magical familiars are highly intelligent little creatures.&nbsp; Researchers have observed rats completing complex mazes, solving lever-action puzzles, and understanding the world around them to a degree unseen in other animals.&nbsp; A clever street-dweller could certainly train a rat to filch food or a few shiny coins from an unwatched coin purse, should the rat get adequate reward itself.&nbsp; Do be wise in your selection of companion, however, as some rats carry deadly diseases from insects that nestle in their short fur.&nbsp; Along with its sharp, clinging claws, the rat packs a powerful bite thanks to its elongated incisor teeth.&nbsp; Be observant, young hero, should you see a rat nearby, for the simple creature may house a secret within its black, unblinking eyes.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813; font-size: 13px;\">\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;

Weasels are tiny, long bodied mammals reaching approximately eight inches in length and bearing coat colorations ranging from chestnut brown to pale white. The weasel’s long body allows it to easily wedge itself into a rodent’s burrow and pull the critter out for a tasty meal. Weasels make quite effective pest controllers in their territories as they eat multitudes of rodents annually. These little cleaners are, however, often considered to be pests in their own right; farmers across the countryside report that their poultry is killed or stolen away by sneaky weasels making their way into their chicken coops. While not the most deadly mammal in the world, the weasel does pack a nasty, sharp-toothed bite. Keep your curious fingers out of any small rodent burrows you find, lest you end up provoking a weasel during his well-earned meal.</p>\n<ul style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size:

I strayed from my mentor, a priest in his middle years with a soft voice and ring of grey-dappled hair about a balding head, to approach a statue set aside within a shadowed alcove.&nbsp; It depicted our god in his humanoid form, an elderly man standing strictly at attention, his wild hair hanging as long as his chest length beard, a staff topped with a stern faced sun clutched in his hand.&nbsp; I knelt, still only fourteen, before this statue and began to pray right then.&nbsp; The next six years of my acolyte training would be nothing but a blessing, I knew.&nbsp;<br><em>“The Gleaming Star”, by Bishop Bernard Portis.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Acolytes are those devoted followers of a particular goddess or god who have decided to take on the mantle of the clergy to better serve their chosen deity.&nbsp; Often no older than teenagers (though some acolytes begin later in their lives) acolytes are trained for a number of years (typically between three to ten) depending on the strictures of their deity’s doctrines.&nbsp; During their time they memorize and study all written materials concerning their deity and their teachings, learn magics (be they healing or harmful) gifted to the acolytes by their deities, and often go out into their community to provide aid to those in need or proselytize the words of their goddess or god.&nbsp; Though not every acolyte climbs the ranks into full fledged priesthood, many remain highly dedicated to the church and remain to serve as life-long acolytes working closely with the lay community outside the temple walls.</p>\n<p>Recall that acolytes are trained in the arcane ways of their chosen deities.&nbsp; This being the case, acolytes rarely receive sufficient martial training in comparison to the paladin ranks of the temple (unless expressly dictated otherwise by their deity’s teachings).&nbsp; This being the case, the acolyte is able to unleash some basic divine magic in order to both defend themselves and allies or to call upon their patron deity for aid for injured parties.&nbsp; Typically expelled in a gleaming shower of golden sparks and dazzlingly vibrant lights, the magic of the gods is truly something special, even at such a base nature.&nbsp; Spells such as Cure Wounds, Sacred Flame, or Sanctuary are all practiced by acolytes early on into their divine studies.&nbsp;

I swear it’s true!<br><em>- Unknown Disorderly Patron at the Brass Buck Tavern.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What more could be said about the humble crab than is not already common knowledge to those who live near or frequent the coasts of the continent. Crabs are uniquely robust little creatures often no larger than the palm of an adult human’s hand, with eight segmented legs protruding from either side of its scallop-shaped carapace. This hardened chitin carapace is topped with two black eye stalks (not unlike those of a snail) through which the beast views our coastlines and oceans. It has been observed that some species of crab lack an armored shell and prefer to squat in the discarded shells of conchs. This gives the crab a rather clever and sturdy mobile home. Adorning the crabs ninth and tenth appendages near its tiny mouth are two massive claws, resembling those of a scorpion, with dull serrations marking the inner edge of each. The crab primarily utilizes these claws in its search for food, cracking open the shells of other tiny aquatic beasts or snipping off tiny pieces of undersea plant life to dine on.</p>\n<p>While perhaps not the most dangerous companion a summoner could wish for, the crab’s ability to breath both in the water and upon land makes the crustacean an ally brimming with utility. I advise caution, however, when first looking through your crab familiar’s eyes, as the sideways scuttling by which the crab moves has proven to cause vomiting in some weak stomached summoners.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li style=\"user-select: text; color: #111111; font-size: 13px;\"><em style=\"user-select: text;\">Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Coastal","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 320","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"tiny","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":-5,"bonus":0,"passive":5,"prof":0,"total":-5},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9,"prof":0,"total":-1}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.monsters.8RgUhb31VvjUNZU1"},"journal-links":{"references":{}}},"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/CrabOrange.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Crab","displayName":40,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/beast/CrabOrange.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":30,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"nv7y3fG2m214Ajfw","actorLink":false,"disposition":0,"displayBars":20,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":"attributes.ac.value"},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"_id":"gvfgesIscW0VALbY","name":"Claw","type":"weapon","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+0 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

In much the same way that an animated skeleton is returned from the dead so too are zombies shunted back into this world.&nbsp; While a skilled spellcaster may animate the dead and command the newly awakened, zombies may also rise in areas of the world saturated with necromantic energy.&nbsp; In this situation, the zombies will not obey the command of a master, but roam aimlessly in a small area until they either find something to attack and consume or rot away into a pile of inanimate bones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Re: Your Brains.</strong> Zombies do retain quite a lot of their former selves in regards to their physical appearance.&nbsp; Zombies will still show the wounds or disease scars which slew them upon reanimating.&nbsp; The symptoms of decay will also be present as many freshly spawned zombies will be bloated, have patches of skin sloughing from their bodies, or even trailing entrails from exploded abdomens.&nbsp; While a zombie may resemble the person they were before, there is nothing at work within the head except mindless hunger.&nbsp; Zombies stumble through their existence in a perpetual state of mindlessness only able to heed their master’s orders.&nbsp; This fact of the zombie’s mind makes them invaluable warriors for a necromancer in need.&nbsp; Zombies are direct and will shamble off towards their quarry without so much as a second thought to their own safety.&nbsp; It’s been noted that some zombies have walked through fires or pits of acid in order to reach their enemies.&nbsp; Once they reach their target, zombies will pummel and bite at their enemy until either they or the enemy fall in the tussle.&nbsp; Zombies may also wield weapons, though not cleverly; zombies will not be able to reclaim a weapon should they be disarmed as the lack of weapon will simply drive them to claw with their broken hands.&nbsp; The magic which binds the zombie to the mortal plane is tricky to the uninitiated as well, so please be warned young adventurers!&nbsp; Should you fell a zombie, be aware that the creature may not be fully dead for the second time; you should always be sure to wait and see if the beast attempts to rise once more before wandering deeper into the dungeon.</p>\n<ul style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; color: #191813;

It is with these powerful wings and their keen vision that an eagle can surprise its prey from soaring heights, giving the avian the element of surprise on unsuspecting prey. I myself have witnessed an eagle swoop down from on high and scoop up a noble woman’s small pet terrier, wrenching the yowling canine from the lady’s grasp before fading away into the afternoon skies. Truly these birds are powerful specimens!</p>\n<p><strong>Touch the Sky.</strong> The eagle prefers solitude when it can find it. The birds nest in homemade eyries, or nests, high above the world on mountain cliff faces. Here in the eyrie, the eagles lay their clutch of two eggs and raise a tiny, insular family with the female (and often much larger) chick taking dominance over any male born into the clan. The chicks grow under the care of their parents, being fed on a diet of regurgitated food until they are large enough to learn how to fly on their own. At this point, baby eagles are shunned from the nest and forced out into the world to fend for themselves.</p>\n<p><strong>Lone Ranger.</strong> Eagles make fine companions for those who understand that these birds of prey are no mere pet, but an equal ally in their adventurers. Rangers seem particularly fond of the eagle as a hunting partner, as the birds may roam far and wide during a hunt and bring their master back any spoils they’ve found on their quest. This specialized form of modern falconry utilizes the eagles as trackers as well, as the eagle may spot prey from a great distance, then return to their master and guide them towards the quarry. Should you be adventuring out into the world and have the patience for such a companion, perhaps consider the eagle as a recommended choice for seasoned hunters.</p>","public":""},"alignment":"Unaligned","race":null,"type":"Beast","environment":"Mountain","cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg.
