The war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves-the drow-found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"116\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Children of Lolth.</span></span> <p>The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do. The wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"117\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Darkness.</span></span> <p>The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"118\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Underdark Cities.</span></span> <p>The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings. A drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"119\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Drow Magic.</span></span> <p>Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"120\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Arms and Armor.</span></span> <p>Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"121\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cutthroat Politics.</span></span> <p>Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Drow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house's social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"122\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Matriarchal Rule.</span></span> <p>Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow-either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can't be priests, nor can they rule a house.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"123\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Poison Predilection.</span></span> <p>Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics.

The war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves-the drow-found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"74\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Children of Lolth.</span></span> <p>The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do. The wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"75\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Darkness.</span></span> <p>The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"76\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Underdark Cities.</span></span> <p>The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings. A drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"77\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Drow Magic.</span></span> <p>Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"78\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Arms and Armor.</span></span> <p>Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"79\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cutthroat Politics.</span></span> <p>Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Drow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house's social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"80\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Matriarchal Rule.</span></span> <p>Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow-either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can't be priests, nor can they rule a house.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"81\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Poison Predilection.</span></span> <p>Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies <a href=\"https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#unconscious_phb\">unconscious</a>. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-inset\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"82\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Variant: Drow Magic Armor and Weapons</span></span><p>Drow often wear magic armor and carry magic weapons that lose their enhancement bonuses permanently if they are exposed to sunlight for 1 hour or longer.</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">A drow wearing a +1 chain shirt and carrying a +1 shortsword has AC 16 and a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">A drow elite warrior wearing +2 studded leather and carrying a +2 shortsword has AC 20 and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">A drow priestess of Lolth wearing +3 scale mail has AC 19.</li></ul><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"neutral evil","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"Elf","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"Underdark","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["elvish","undercommon"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Drow","displayName":20,"img":"https://5e.tools/img/MM/Drow.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":120,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"RTMLproDXC1SKJ8B","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"alpha":1},"items":[{"_id":"O7pK2HnN1xlJvCFY","name":"Darkness","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration.

The war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves-the drow-found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"96\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Children of Lolth.</span></span> <p>The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do. The wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"97\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Darkness.</span></span> <p>The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"98\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Underdark Cities.</span></span> <p>The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings. A drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"99\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Drow Magic.</span></span> <p>Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"100\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Arms and Armor.</span></span> <p>Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"101\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cutthroat Politics.</span></span> <p>Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Drow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house's social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"102\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Matriarchal Rule.</span></span> <p>Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow-either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can't be priests, nor can they rule a house.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"103\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Poison Predilection.</span></span> <p>Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies <a href=\"https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#unconscious_phb\">unconscious</a>. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-inset\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"104\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Variant: Drow Magic Armor and Weapons</span></span><p>Drow often wear magic armor and carry magic weapons that lose their enhancement bonuses permanently if they are exposed to sunlight for 1 hour or longer.</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">A drow wearing a +1 chain shirt and carrying a +1 shortsword has AC 16 and a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">A drow elite warrior wearing +2 studded leather and carrying a +2 shortsword has AC 20 and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">A drow priestess of Lolth wearing +3 scale mail has AC 19.</li></ul><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"neutral evil","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"Elf","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"Underdark","cr":7,"spellLevel":10,"xp":{"value":2900},"source":"MM","class":{"level":10,"name":"wizard"}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["elvish","undercommon"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"arc":{"value":1,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9},"dec":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":3,"bonus":0,"passive":13},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ste":{"value":1,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":4,"override":null,"max":4},"spell2":{"value":3,"override":null,"max":3},"spell3":{"value":3,"override":null,"max":3},"spell4":{"value":3,"override":null,"max":3},"spell5":{"value":2,"override":null,"max":2},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Drow Mage","displayName":20,"img":"https://5e.tools/img/MM/Drow Mage.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":120,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"0ftL9ofL5O7FLN0L","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"alpha":1},"items":[{"_id":"BxRIDHBMLqUji29i","name":"Darkness","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration.

The war among elvenkind ended when the good elves banished their malevolent kin to the subterranean depths. Here, in the lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages, the dark elves-the drow-found refuge. They also found leadership in the only elven deity who had not forsaken them. At her command, the dark elves built an empire in the underworld.</p><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"85\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Children of Lolth.</span></span> <p>The drow worship Lolth, a deity who resides in the Abyss. Known as the Spider Queen or the Demon Queen of Spiders, she is the figure around which the dark elves have built their subterranean civilization. Whatever she demands, the drow do. The wickedest of elves, drow are seldom seen by the surface world. Though they plot to destroy the elves that banished them, they no longer see themselves as exiles. They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"86\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Creatures of Darkness.</span></span> <p>The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"87\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Underdark Cities.</span></span> <p>The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings. A drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"88\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Drow Magic.</span></span> <p>Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"89\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Arms and Armor.</span></span> <p>Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"90\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Cutthroat Politics.</span></span> <p>Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>Drow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house's social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"91\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Matriarchal Rule.</span></span> <p>Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div><p>In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow-either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can't be priests, nor can they rule a house.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--3\" data-title-index=\"92\"> <span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Poison Predilection.</span></span> <p>Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies <a href=\"https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#unconscious_phb\">unconscious</a>. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.</p><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__b-inset\"><span class=\"rd__h rd__h--2-inset\" data-title-index=\"93\"><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">Variant: Drow Magic Armor and Weapons</span></span><p>Drow often wear magic armor and carry magic weapons that lose their enhancement bonuses permanently if they are exposed to sunlight for 1 hour or longer.</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">A drow wearing a +1 chain shirt and carrying a +1 shortsword has AC 16 and a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">A drow elite warrior wearing +2 studded leather and carrying a +2 shortsword has AC 20 and a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.</li><li class=\"rd__li \">A drow priestess of Lolth wearing +3 scale mail has AC 19.</li></ul><div class=\"float-clear\"></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"neutral evil","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"Elf","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"Underdark","cr":5,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":1800},"source":"MM","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["elvish","undercommon"],"custom":""}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"ste":{"value":2,"ability":"dex","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"Drow Elite Warrior","displayName":20,"img":"https://5e.tools/img/MM/Drow Elite Warrior.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":120,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"hk3o7aV8MLhxPgLw","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"alpha":1},"items":[{"_id":"d5NJ5abKCJBtp47z","name":"Darkness","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration.

Tapped into this dark power, the \"C\" Team's hoards person sees all existence as a puzzle to unlock, and he is obsessed by the essential lack of meaning and purpose in the structures of so-called \"reality.\" Still, all things considered, he is most often polite and affable. Because after a long adventuring career, he understands that he can't afford to make more enemies.</p><p>Given his blue skin tone, rumors suggest that K'thriss is of mixed heritage, but no one knows for sure. As a young and doubting adherent of Lolth, he stumbled upon fragments of a relic known as the Black Altar, exposing him to their infinite truths and shocking the drow's hair jet-black. His matching \"beard\" is actually a slow-growing colony of inert spores that K'thriss believes makes him look distinguished. Possessed of alarming and asymmetric crystalline eyes, he often wears a blindfold to spare others his visage, seeing through the eyes of his familiar while he does.</p><p>Tentacles play a big part in K'thriss's spellcasting, whether wrenching him through the sky when he uses magic to fly, or manifesting in dark, suckered form when he casts spells such as thorn whip. And when enemies hear K'thriss whisper the deep truths of the Ur-typically something about how on a geologic time scale, everyone's desires are meaningless-they remember it.</p><p>K'thriss's familiar, Ligotti, is a semisapient remnant of a tentacle attack, spawned by the warlock's intercessor patron god. Though entirely alien to the material plane (and often appearing in the form of a staff), Ligotti uses the stat block of a poisonous snake with these changes:</p><ul class=\"rd__list\"><li class=\"rd__li \">It has an Intelligence score of 12 (+2).</li><li class=\"rd__li \">It has telepathy out to a range of 30 feet.</li></ul></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div><div class=\"rd__spc-inline-post\"></div></div>","public":""},"alignment":"chaotic neutral","race":"","type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"Elf","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"","cr":3,"spellLevel":5,"xp":{"value":700},"source":"AI","class":{"level":5,"name":"warlock"},"notes1name":"","notes2name":"","notes3name":"","notes4name":""},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":["celestial","common","elvish","custom"],"custom":"Undercommon; can read all writing"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"arc":{"value":1,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","mod":-1,"bonus":0,"passive":9},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ins":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"inv":{"value":1,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","mod":4,"bonus":0,"passive":14},"rel":{"value":1,"ability":"int","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","mod":2,"bonus":0,"passive":12},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":2,"override":2,"max":2,"level":5},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":20}}},"token":{"flags":{},"name":"K'thriss Drow'b","displayName":20,"img":"https://5e.tools/img/AI/K'thriss Drow'b.png","tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":true,"dimSight":120,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"gfqY2yqlVvY3QzY4","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":null},"randomImg":false,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"alpha":1},"items":[{"_id":"KHn9aSz0uhu7vbCE","name":"Darkness","type":"spell","data":{"description":{"value":"<div  class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration.
